* Overview
This repository includes some of my Lisp tools used in my everyday work. All the tools are very personal, which means I may not provide detailed support and they may have bugs. Also, because they are for my personal use, the interface or usage may not be user-friendly, leading some people to find them difficult to use.

Nevertheless, I am sharing these tools for people who have a similar working style to mine. It is highly appreciated if you download the tools, and even more so if you provide feedback for any improvements.
* correct-or-translate-by-gpt.el
